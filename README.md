# Assignment #3: Poetry Site

**This assignment is a simple webpage of a poem I wrote. View this project at: walker.rout.ca**

## Getting Started With the Project

> This project is written in a local style, meaning that I have not set it up on any domain. If you would like to run this project, download the files, and set them them up inside a new, empty directory. Open up the *"index.html"* file located in the main directory in a web browser (this is achieved by either right clicking the file and launching with a certain web browser, or opening up a web browser page and dragging the file into it). Doing this will display the project's main web page.
